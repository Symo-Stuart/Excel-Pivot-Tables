# Excel Product Distribution and Sales Data Analysis Project
## Overview
    Welcome to the Excel Product Distribution and Sales Data Analysis project! This repository contains two Excel files that showcase the power of pivot tables for analyzing product distribution and sales data.
    
    The project is divided into two parts, with the first file focusing on creating a basic pivot table, and the second file delving into more advanced pivot table functions, including filtering, slicing, report creation, timelines, grouping, sorting, and pivot charts.

## Project Structure

### File 1: Basic Pivot Table Creation
In this Excel file (basic_pivot_table.xlsx), we explore the fundamental concepts of creating a pivot table to analyze product distribution and sales data. 

**The main learning outcomes of this part include:**

- Understanding the structure and format of the source data required for pivot tables.
- Learning how to create a basic pivot table from scratch and selecting the appropriate fields.
- Summarizing and aggregating data using pivot table functions, such as Sum, Count, and Average.
- Organizing data efficiently using row labels, column labels, and value fields.
- Using calculated fields and calculated items to derive custom metrics from the raw data.

### File 2: Advanced Pivot Table Functions and Pivot Charts
In this Excel file (advanced_pivot_table.xlsx), we build upon the knowledge gained in the first file and explore more advanced pivot table functionalities.

**The key learning outcomes of this section include:**

- Utilizing filtering and slicing to narrow down the data and focus on specific product categories, regions, or time periods.
- Creating interactive reports with pivot table features like pivot charts and timelines.
- Grouping and sorting data to gain insights into product distribution patterns and sales trends.
- Implementing pivot table best practices to improve data analysis efficiency and accuracy.

## How to Use This Repository

- *Clone or download the repository to your local machine.*
- *Open the first Excel file (basic_pivot_table.xlsx) to understand the basics of pivot table creation and data analysis.*
- *Experiment with the examples in the first file and try creating your own basic pivot tables using different datasets.*
- *Proceed to the second Excel file (advanced_pivot_table.xlsx) to explore more advanced pivot table functions and pivot charts.*
- *Study the various pivot table configurations and observe how filtering, grouping, and sorting impact data visualization.*
- *Apply the concepts learned to your own product distribution and sales data for more insightful analysis.*
